# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

Work Day Scheduler allows users to simply plan their workday by typing tasks into the text box. This site allows the user to save their tasks by clicking the save button. Once tasks are saved they persist even after the user reloads the page. Tasks are also color coded to the current hour so the user knows what they should be focused on.

## Features

- Current date display
- Time blocks are color coded for past, present, and future
- Save tasks to local storage
